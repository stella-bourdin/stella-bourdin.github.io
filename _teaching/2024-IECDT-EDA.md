Along with two colleagues, we have created a one-day hands-on course on Environmental Data Analysis. 
It aims to teach students the main Python packages used in environmental data analysis, while also giving them to keys to solving their own coding problems. 
It focuses includes: pandas for text and csv files; xarray for netcdf files and satellite data; matplotlib and cartopy for plotting maps.
The course is based on open-source notebooks which can be found [here](https://github.com/bobbyantonio/iecdt_environmental_data_analysis).
