At the request of CentraleSupelec's Fluid Mechanics professor, I created this 9h (3x3h) practical on Atmospheric Circulation. 
It consists in teaching the students how to run a Atmospheric Global Climate Model (LMDZ), 
and letting them create experiments to answer their own atmospheric circulation questions.
