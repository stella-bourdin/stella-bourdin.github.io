I am currently a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Oxford, within the [Huracán project](https://research.reading.ac.uk/huracan/about-huracan/project-overview/). I obtained my PhD in Geosciences from the Université Paris-Saclay, under the direction of Sébastien Fromang at the LSCE-IPSL, with a thesis intitled ["Tropical and Mediterranean Cyclone in the IPSL Climate Model: detection and assessment"](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04585459)

I previously obtained an engineering degree in Energy, with an internship at EDF (Electricité de France), and I kept a keen interest in the interaction between the weather and climate and the **energy systems**. 

**Research**: 
In my research, **I aim to understand the present variability of cyclonic activity to better predict the future**. 
I am particularly interested in tropical cyclones reaching Europe and hybrid subtropical cyclones. I developed technical expertise in a suite of tools that allow me to study cyclones in any weather or climate data, including tracking ([Bourdin et al. 2022](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/15/6759/2022/)), track analysis, cyclone phase space and vizualisation  (see Software Development below). I work in particular with Global Climate Models (GCMs) ([Bourdin et al., 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-024-07138-w)) and seasonal hindcast simulations. 

**Teaching**:
I am passionate about the science underpinning climate change to the next generation of leaders. 
I have been able to do so in two of France's best engineering schools (CentraleSupélec & ENSTA) and at the University of Oxford. 

**Software development**:
I am also passionate about open science. In particular, I invest time in developing open-source Python packages to make the analysis of cyclone track data more accessible and reproducible. Check-out my two main projects: 
* [HuracanPy](https://github.com/Huracan-project/huracanpy): Reading and performing basic analyses on cyclone track data
* [CPyS](https://github.com/stella-bourdin/CPyS): Efficient computation of the cyclone phase space parameters (in combination with [TempestExtremes](https://climate.ucdavis.edu/tempestextremes.php)).
