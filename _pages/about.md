In the meantime, please checkout my links of the left-hand side bar and/or [my page on the website of the University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/bourdin).


In my research, **I aim to understand the present variability of cyclonic activity to better predict the future**. 
I am particularly interested in **tropical cyclones reaching Europe** and **hybrid subtropical cyclones**. I developed **technical expertise in a suite of tools that allow me to study cyclones** in any weather or climate data. I work in particular with Global Climate Models (GCMs) and Seasonal hindcast simulations. 

I am currently a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Oxford, within the [Huracán project](https://research.reading.ac.uk/huracan/about-huracan/project-overview/). I obtained my PhD in Geosciences from the Université Paris-Saclay, under the direction of Sébastien Fromang at the LSCE-IPSL. 

I previously obtained an engineering degree in Energy, and I kept a keen interest in the interaction between the weather and climate and the **energy systems**. 

I am also passionate about teaching climate science to the next generation of leaders. I had the opportunity to do so in two of France's best engineering schools (CentraleSupélec & ENSTA) and at the University of Oxford.
