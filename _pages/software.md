Software development is a part of my research I really enjoy. 
I am passionate about open science, and I invest time in developing open-source Python packages to make the analysis of cyclone track data more accessible and reproducible. 
At the moment, I have two main projects: 
* [HuracanPy](https://github.com/Huracan-project/huracanpy): Reading and performing basic analyses on cyclone track data.
* [CPyS](https://github.com/stella-bourdin/CPyS): Efficient computation of the cyclone phase space parameters (in combination with [TempestExtremes](https://climate.ucdavis.edu/tempestextremes.php)).

* You can check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/stella-bourdin).
