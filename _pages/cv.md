Service and leadership
======
I was one of the main organizers of [TROPICANA](TODO), a one-month research program at the [Institut Pascal](TODO) dedicated to the understanding of Mediterranean and Tropical Cyclones in a changing climate ([BAMS Paper](TODO))

I served as Representative of PhD students and non-permanent staff at the LSCE Lab Council for two years. I am now a post-doc member of the AOPP Postgrad society. 

I completed 5 peer-reviews, for journals including WCE, IJCC, ESE, JOSS.
